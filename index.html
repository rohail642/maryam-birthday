i cant believe how its already been so many years minna, time really flies doesn’t it. meri minna I have seen you grow from ground 0, and its been the most amazing thing to witness. there is nothing in this world that i would want other than you. I still remember where i was and what i was doing before proposing you, couch mai mere didi ke ghar let ke aapko text karra tha, with the mindset of being with you forever and never letting go of your hand once i held it🥺. We have been through every milestone that could possibly come up, and passed them to be here, together right now. Kaise samjhaun aapko ke kitna pyaar karta hun aapse. aap jab qareeb nai hotin to har waqt phone baazu rakhta hun ke kab msg aajaein and i respond to you instantly. 4 saal se wahi frequency mai hun baby, i never went down. aapko dekh ke tasalli hoti hai jab stressed hota hun. aapki wo ek hasi itni qeemti hai mere liye ke there is no material in this world that can do justice to it. you never made me feel alone my jaan, every problem that i faced and when i used to feel bad, aap mujhe console kartin, qasam se uske baad se wo problem wouldnt even come in my mind again. I am so grateful for having you in my life, because i wouldn’t want it with anyone but you. you are my laugh, you are my pain, you are my soul my heart my sab kuch, bohot precious ho yaar aap. bohot yaad kiya hun aapko these weeks but it made me realize ke how important you are in my life. you fulfill me minna. And i promise you that ill be the best boyfriend and husband to you. Because you deserve it my love. remember when we used to talk about names for our kids? it was the cutest. But one thing i know is, its going to come true baby inshallah. you and i will be the best couple out there with cute littul babiesh of our own🥺.  I love when you smile, when you laugh, when you make the faces that you make🙃, when you feel sleepy, when you call me by my name🥺. wallahi i cant wait to experience all of this physically. remember the time when you and me just looked at each other in video call for a while and started crying🥺. how cute was it🥺. remember when you sent me your hand and i made it as my wallpaper, coz thats how badly i wanted to make you mine. i love the “oil” paintings you made for us🥺, and i remember how angy you got when i told u the lemon one isnt my wallpaper 😂. and the words you used to ban and emojis tooo😂. aapki wo skincare wali video for me, aapki cooking videos. qasam se there are so many!! Certainly allah has blessed me with the best person. And cheers to the upcoming memories we are gonna make together. cant wait to hold your hand and kiss your forehead after we marry. Our shaadi will be perfect🥺. ill really cry baby nikah ke din, qasam se🥺. and uss din ke baad se bas aapka hojaunga forever. Baby i promise ill be the one who you can rely on, who you can share everything with. ill always be there to support you, to listen your cute baatein, to just be there for you no matter what. I cant wait to build a house just like you want, dur with our own agriculture. wouldnt that be the best?
har dream adhuri hai aapke bina meri minnu. there is no rouhi without his minna.
aur likhne ka mann hai but phir aap bore hojaengi and mujhe maarengi, but know that these words cannot describe my love for you minnu, wallahi they are nothing.
happy 19th meri soulmate, meri jaan, mere bacchon ki ammi, meri wifey, meri bubbu meri shonuuuu. (a little bit of cliche to the older letter, hope you noticed hehe)
i hope allah gives you everything you deserve and bless you with good health, and most importantly, you meet me and continue your venture as “our” venture. aameen. i love you more than yesterday and less than tomorrow baby. I hope you liked this small treat, my minnu my jaan.💘
